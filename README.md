# Reiddragon's vimrc

Just my vimrc, bunch of addons I find useful, and some themes I like to rotate
between. I mostly use it with Vim (not Neovim) in Kitty or GVim, with Hack Nerd
Font Mono or Fairfax SM, on Linux, so there's a bias towards that setup.

## Installation
Clone the repo to:

- `~/.vim/` on Linux, \*BSD, macOS
- `~/config/settings/vim/` on HaikuOS
- `$HOME\vimfiles` on Windows (usually `C:\Users\[username]\vimfiles`)

I use [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) to manage plugins, so to
install all extensions, install Plug then simply run

```
:PlugInstall
```

## Extensions I use
- Themes
    - [Base16](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16-vim) - loads of great
    schemes there, also some weird ones
    - [Embark](https://github.com/embark-theme/vim) - amazing neon scheme,
    using it with [\[shameless
    plug\]](https://github.com/Reiddragon/embark-konsole)
    - [Kyoto Night](https://github.com/laniusone/kyotonight.vim) - like Tokyo
    Night, but in a different city
    - [Iceberg](https://github.com/cocopon/iceberg.vim) - amazing cold scheme

- Additional Language Support Plugins (for stuff Polyglot doesn't cover)
    - [Hy](https://github.com/hylang/vim-hy)
    - [Onnisharp](https://github.com/OmniSharp/Omnisharp-vim) and [SharpenUp](https://github.com/nickspoons/vim-sharpenup)
